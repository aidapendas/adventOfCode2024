# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This repository contains my solutions to the programming challenges presented during the Advent of Code 2024 event.

## 📖 About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles, created by Eric Wastl. These puzzles are designed for programmers of all levels and can be solved in any programming language. Participants often use these challenges for:

- Interview preparation
- Company training
- University coursework
- Personal skill development
- Friendly competitions

The puzzles are released daily during December, leading up to Christmas, starting on **December 1st**.
